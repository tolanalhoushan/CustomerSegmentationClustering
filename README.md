# Customer Segmentation
A project that identifies Customers segmenting using Agglomerative hierarchal clustering based on Age, Annual Income, Spending Score to determine the optimal segments and create clustering profiles.

# Problem Statement
Successful Marketing relies on diverse customer groups. The dataset provided showed varied characteristics the makes a uniform strategy effective impossible.
The goal of the project was:

- Develop a hierarchal agglomerative clustering algorithm that identifies different customers segments
- Identify the different Customers Profiles with varying features for the targeted strategies in  business.
  
# Dataset
Mall_Customers.csv
# Content
1- Data Acquisition and Exploration: loading the data and addressing any missing values while focusing on Age,Annual Income and Spending Score.

2- Building the model: Deciding the best number of clusters By applying the Agglomerative Clustering algorithm and using the Dendrogram to visually analyze it.

3- Evaluating the model: using Dendrogram Analysis for Visual justification selecting K examining the vertical cut-off point, Cluster profiling by calculating the mean of the focused features for each cluster and the Heat-map for visualizing the average values for immediate recognition of the distinct segments.

4- Results and Insights: The model successfully clustered the customers into 5 distinct groups,while demonstrating differences such as "Younger, Low-income , High-Spending Score" or " Older, High-income, Low-Spending Score".
